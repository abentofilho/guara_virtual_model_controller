	abstract = {The paper reports on a project to make a quadruped robot walk with medium forward speed on irregular terrain in an outdoor environment using a neural system model. The necessary conditions for stable dynamic walking on irregular terrain in general are proposed, and the neural system is designed by comparing biological concepts with those necessary conditions described in physical terms. A {PD}-controller is used at joints to construct a virtual spring—damper system as the visco-elasticity model of a muscle. The neural system model consists of a {CPG} (central pattern generator), responses and reflexes. A response directly and quickly modulates the {CPG} phase, and a reflex directly generates joint torque. The state of the virtual spring—damper system is switched, based on the {CPG} phase. In order to make a self-contained quadruped (called Tekken2) walk on natural ground, several new reflexes and responses are developed in addition to those developed in previous studies. A flexor reflex prevents a leg from stumbling on small bumps and pebbles. A sideways stepping reflex stabilizes rolling motion on a sideways inclined slope. A corrective stepping reflex/response prevents the robot from falling down in the case of loss of ground contact. A crossed flexor reflex helps a swinging leg keep enough clearance between the toe and the ground. The effectiveness of the proposed neural system model control and especially the newly developed reflexes and responses are validated by indoor and outdoor experiments using Tekken2. A {CPG} receives sensory feedback as a result of motions induced by reflexes, and changes the period of its own active phase. Since a {CPG} has the ability of mutual entrainment with pitching motion of legs and rolling motion of the body in addition, the consistency between motion of a leg temporally modified by a reflex and motions of the other legs is maintained autonomously. It is shown that {CPGs} can be the center of sensorimotor coordination, and that the neural system model simply defining the relationships between {CPGs}, sensory input, reflexes and mechanical system works very well even in complicated tasks such as adaptive dynamic walking on unstructured natural ground.},

	abstract = {Biological systems are able to perform movements in unpredictable environments more elegantly than traditionally engineered robotic systems. A current limitation of robotic systems is their inability to simultaneously and independently control both joint angle and joint stiffness without electromechanical feedback loops, which can reduce system stability. In this paper, we describe the development and physical implementation of a servo-actuated robotic joint that uses antagonistic, series-elastic actuation with novel nonlinear spring mechanisms. These mechanisms form a real-time mechanical feedback loop that provides the joint with angle and stiffness control through differential and common-mode actuation of the servos, respectively. This approach to joint control emulates the mechanics of antagonistic muscle groups used by animals, and we experimentally show that it is capable of independently controlling both joint angle and joint stiffness using a simple open-loop control algorithm.},

	abstract = {Bionic quadruped robots received considerable worldwide research attention. For a quadruped robot walking with steady paces on a flat terrain, using a cam drive control mechanism instead of servomotors provides theoretical and practical benefits as it reduces the system weight, cost, and control complexities; thus it may be more cost beneficial for some recreational or household applications. This study explores the robot step mechanism including the leg and cam drive control systems based on studying the bone structure and the kinematic step sequences of dog. The design requirements for the cam drive robot legs have been raised, and the mechanical principles of the leg operating mechanism as well as the control parameters have been analyzed. A cam drive control system was constructed using three cams to control each leg. Finally, a four-leg demo robot was manufactured for experiments and it showed stable walking patterns on a flat floor.},

	abstract = {Research into legged robotics is primarily motivated by the prospects of building machines that are able to navigate in challenging and complex environments that are predominantly non-ﬂat. In this context, control of contact forces is fundamental to ensure stable contacts and stability of the robot. In this extended abstract we propose a planning/control framework for quasi-static walking for quadrupedal robots, implemented for a demanding application in which regulation of ground reaction forces is crucial for the success of the walking behaviour. Experimental results demonstrate that our 75-kg quadruped robot is able to walk inside two high-slope (50◦) V-shaped walls; an achievement that to the authors’ best knowledge has never been presented before. The robot is able to distribute its weight among the stance legs while ensuring no foot slippage and fulﬁll the unilateral constraints of the contact forces. The approach makes use of a simpliﬁed model of the robot. Experimental evidence shows that even a lower dimensional model with the assumption of quasi-staticity is sufﬁcient to perform the required task.},

	abstract = {In this paper the control of a quadruped standing jump over irregular terrain obstacles is investigated. Control strategies are developed for thetakeoff, flight and thelanding phases of a standing jump. Using a simplified planar model and the concept ofeffective linear momentum, simple feedforward leg force profiles are planned to remove the linear and angular momentum of the body during landing. Super real-time simulation, which involves predicting landing conditions based on faster than real-time simulation using the simplified model, is used to select leg touchdown angles for landing. Using the principle of symmetry, the leg forces during takeoff are derived from those predicted for landing. Leg motions are planned to maximize clearance during flight and stability during landing. Using these strategies, the quadruped is able to clear a variety of obstacles including isolated walls, terrain steps, and ditches. Simulation results are compared with experimental data of an animal jump from the literature.},
